Building an Active Directory lab to practice user management, group policies, and security configurations.



# Active Directory Security Lab (In Progress) 🔐

 **Overview**  
This project is a **work in progress**, where I am setting up an **Active Directory (AD) lab** to practice Windows domain administration, security configurations, and incident response techniques.

 **Goals of the Lab**
- Deploy and configure **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**.
- Implement **user authentication & group policies**.
- Set up **logging and monitoring for security incidents**.
- Perform **privilege escalation & mitigation exercises**.
- Explore **SIEM integration for threat detection**.

  **Tools & Technologies**
- **Windows Server 2019/2022**
- **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**
- **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)**
- **PowerShell for automation**
- **Sysmon & Event Viewer for logging**

  **Current Progress**
- ✅ Installed Windows Server & AD DS  
- ✅ Created Users & Organizational Units (OUs)  
- 🔄 Configuring Group Policies (WIP)  
- 🔄 Implementing security logging & alerts  

  **Next Steps**
- Implement **Kerberoasting & Pass-the-Hash attacks** for red teaming.
- Apply **defensive security measures** to mitigate common AD threats.
- Document findings and best practices.
